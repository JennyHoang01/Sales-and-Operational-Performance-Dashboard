# Sales-and-Operational-Performance-Dashboard
The primary goal of this project was to establish a reliable, automated data workflow to clean and standardize messy source data, calculate key performance indicators (KPIs), and visualize operational performance across sales, customer service, and logistics (SLA). The final dashboard allows stakeholders to quickly identify performance bottlenecks, such as areas with low customer satisfaction or high delivery failure rates.
